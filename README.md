# personal-redacted_word
redacts every third word from a string, paragraph, or text file 


This isn't a program with much practical use but it was merely a challenge for me that I was interested. I created a program that redacts the third word in a string by replcing all the letters with "x". I created this project becuase I didn't know how to do this task initially, and saw it as a challenge I wanted to complete.


This code can be easily refactored for use in a textfile, I simply didn't have a textfile to play around with.
